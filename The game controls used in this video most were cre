The game controls used in this video most were created just to be different. Most all game controls are supposed to set up in a way to allow the player to play their game the best way possible. In a couple cases in these videos theÂ  game was designed around the controls instead of the other way around. Of course the game play is totally effected and decided by how well the controls are laid out. If the player ( ME) ,can't figure them out they are not gonna play the game.
