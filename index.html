        <p>This is a tribute to the man I only got to know for a short time, my Dad. He was a Buisness owner, Husband, Father, and a piller of the community. Would volunteer his help and or advice whenever he was called upon. Those that knew him showed him a great deal of respect and admiration.</p>
